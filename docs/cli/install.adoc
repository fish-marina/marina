Install one or more packages.

== USAGE
  mar install <spec> [<spec> [...]]    Install package by name or URL
  mar install                          Install missing packages from bundle

== DESCRIPTION
Installs packages identified by each <spec> given. A package can be specified either by name or by a URL.

When specifying a package by name, the package name is searched for in each package repository currently installed. The first matching package is selected and downloaded. See `mar help repositories` for more information about repositories.

When a package is specified by URL, MAR assumes the URL points to a Git repository and installs the package by cloning the repository.

When called without arguments, any packages specified in your bundle file that are missing will be installed.

== EXAMPLES
  mar install brew
  mar install https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-brew
  mar install brew spark
  mar install
