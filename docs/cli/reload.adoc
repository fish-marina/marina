Reload the current shell.

== USAGE
  mar reload

== DESCRIPTION
Reload Marina and all plugins by using `exec` to replace current shell process with a brand new process.

This command tries to be as safe as possible, mitigating side-effects caused by exec and preventing the reload in case of background processes.
